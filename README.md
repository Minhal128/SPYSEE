<p>I am pleased to announce the development of **SPYSEE**, my first malware as a Cyber Security student specializing in red teaming. SPYSEE is a sophisticated keylogger designed to capture and record keystrokes on a target system, gathering sensitive information such as credentials and messages. This project has been a significant milestone in my journey, providing valuable hands-on experience with offensive security techniques. Developing SPYSEE has deepened my understanding of keylogging methods and the importance of defending against such threats, reinforcing my passion for mastering the complexities of cybersecurity..<p/>

<h2>üîé Project Preview</h2>
<p>To get a sneak peek of the project, go ahead and run this on your device... if you're in the mood for some digital thrill-seeking (don't worry, your keyboard might survive). Just kidding!no need to panic! üòÑ</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Our project SPYSEE offers a range of functionalities " Beware of us "
<ul>
  <li>Keystroke Logging: Records every keystroke pressed by the user, including special keys like space, enter, tab, and control.</li>
  <li>Screenshot Capture: Automatically captures screenshots of the screen every time the spacebar is pressed, providing visual evidence of user activity.</li>
  <li>Camera Snapshots: Takes pictures using the system‚Äôs camera whenever the "Enter" key is pressed, capturing the environment in real-time.</li>
  <li>Clipboard Monitoring: Captures the contents of the clipboard when the "Ctrl" key is pressed, logging any copied text or sensitive data.</li>
  <li>Silent Background Operation: The keylogger runs quietly in the background without alerting the user, making it highly discreet.</li>
  <li>Scheduled Shutdown: On pressing the "Tab" key, the system is scheduled to shut down in 60 seconds.</li>
  <li>Email Reporting (Optional): Logs can be sent directly to the specified email address, providing a remote monitoring option.</li>
  <li>Automatic File Logging: Keylogs, screenshots, clipboard data, and camera captures are stored locally in designated folders for easy access.</li>
  <li>Customizable Reporting Interval: Choose the interval for generating reports, with logs being saved or emailed every specified number of seconds.</li>
  <li>Seamless Deployment: Converts SPYSEE and other Python scripts into standalone executables, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and bundling all dependencies into a single file for easy distribution and execution on any system without requiring Python.</li>
  <li>Remote Data Transmission: Sends captured data directly to a specified server IP for centralized collection, eliminating local storage on the attacked machine.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Working </h2>
<p>
  This keylogger captures keystrokes and system events, including screenshots, webcam images, and clipboard data, while sending reports at specified intervals. Below is a detailed breakdown of its functionalities:
<h3><li>Modules Used</li></h3>
<ul>
  <li>opencv-python</li>
  <li>Pillow</li>
  <li>pyperclip</li>
  <li>keyboard</li>
  <li>request</li>
</ul>  

</p>
<h3>Working</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Key Logging:</strong> The keylogger uses the keyboard library to listen for keyboard events.
        When a key is pressed, the <code>key_press</code> method captures the key name and appends it to the log.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Logging Mechanism:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuously logs keystrokes to a string variable.</li>
            <li>
                At regular intervals (defined by <code>SEND_REPORT_EVERY</code>, set to 40 seconds), the <code>report</code> method is invoked to handle log data:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sends logs via email or saves them to a file based on the specified report method.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>File and Email Reporting:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Logs can be sent through email using the <code>smtplib</code> library, formatted in both plain text and HTML:</li>
            <li><strong>Email Configuration:</strong> Requires valid email credentials for sending logs.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, logs are appended to <code>keylog.txt</code> in the designated shared folder (<code>H:\Development\logme</code>).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Screenshot and Webcam Capture:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Captures screenshots using <code>ImageGrab</code> from the <code>PIL</code> library, saving them in the <code>screenshots</code> directory.</li>
            <li>Takes webcam pictures using <code>OpenCV</code>, storing them in the <code>camera_pics</code> directory.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Clipboard Monitoring:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitors the clipboard for changes and saves its content to <code>clipboard.txt</code> each time the Ctrl key is pressed:</li>
            <li>Timestamps each entry for tracking when the clipboard data was captured.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Scheduled Shutdown:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Offers the ability to shut down the computer 60 seconds after pressing the Tab key:</li>
            <li>Ensures users are notified of the scheduled shutdown.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Silent Operation:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed to operate discreetly without user interaction or visible output:</li>
            <li>The logging process continues in the background until stopped by pressing the <code>Esc</code> key.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>To run the keylogger:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure the necessary libraries are installed (<code>opencv-python</code>, <code>Pillow</code>, <code>pyperclip</code>, <code>keyboard</code>).</li>
    <li>Update the email settings with valid credentials.</li>
    <li>Execute the script to allow it to run in the background, capturing the specified data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important Note</h3>
<p>This keylogger is intended for educational purposes and ethical hacking. Always obtain explicit permission from users before running such software on their devices.</p>
